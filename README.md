## Hardware Setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

## Using the Code Example

### In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](http://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. Enter the local path in the **Application(s) Root Path** field to indicate where the application needs to be created.

   Applications that can share libraries can be placed in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Command-line Interface (CLI):

ModusToolbox provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool to easily create one or more ModusToolbox applications. See the "Project Creator Tools" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) for more details.

Alternatively, you can manually create the application using the following steps:

1. Download and unzip this repository onto your local machine, or clone the repository.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the application folder.

   On Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. On Windows, open the **modus-shell** app from the Start menu.

   **Note:** The cloned application contains a default BSP file (*TARGET_xxx.mtb*) in the *deps* folder. Use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) (`make modlibs` command) to select and download a different BSP file, if required. If the selected kit does not have the required resources or is not [supported](#supported-kits-make-variable-target), the application may not work.

3. Import the required libraries by executing the `make getlibs` command.

Various CLI tools include a `-h` option that prints help information to the terminal screen about that tool. For more details, see the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

### In Third-party IDEs:

1. Follow the instructions from the [CLI](#in-command-line-interface-cli) section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

    For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*.

3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board.

   - **Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox:**

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.

   - **Using CLI:**

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. You can specify a target and toolchain manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the terminal application displays the main menu with current time from the RTC along with the message as shown in Figure 1.
   
    **Figure 1. Terminal Window On Startup** 

    ![Figure 1](images/terminal_output_1.png)

5. Type '1' in the main menu. You will be prompted for new date and time. Enter the new date and time, and press **Enter**. 

   If incorrect date or time is entered a warning message will be printed. 

    **Figure 2. 'Set Time' Command**

    ![Figure 2](images/terminal_output_2.png)

6. Type '2' in the main menu. You will be prompted for configuring the daylight saving time (DST) feature in the sub menu. 

   The current DST status will be displayed along with available DST Commands.

    **Figure 3. 'Configure DST Feature' Command**

    ![Figure 3](images/terminal_output_3.png)

7. Type '1' in the sub menu. You will be prompted for the DST format (Fixed DST Format or Relative DST Format), followed by the new DST start and end time. Enter the DST format and press **Enter** . Then enter new DST start and end time and press **Enter**. If incorrect date or time is entered a warning message will be printed. 

    **Figure 4. 'Enable DST Feature' Command**

    ![Figure 4](images/terminal_output_4.png)
    
      **Note:** In areas of the world that practice DST, when it should begin and end is not unique. It can either be in fixed DST format or in relative DST format.

      An example of fixed DST format: begins on 21st March and ends on 21st September.

      An example of relative DST format: begins on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October.

8. Type '2' in the sub menu to disable the DST feature.

    **Figure 5. 'Disable DST Feature' Command**

    ![Figure 5](images/terminal_output_5.png)

9. Type '3' in the sub menu to quit DST configuration. 

    **Figure 6. 'Quit DST Configuration' Command**

    ![Figure 6](images/terminal_output_6.png)

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide.

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and Implementation

### Resources and Settings

**Table 1. Application Resources**

| Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     |
| :------- | :------------    | :------------ |
| UART (HAL)|cy_retarget_io_uart_obj| UART HAL object used by Retarget-IO for Debug UART port  |
| RTC  (HAL)|rtc_obj| RTC HAL object for RTC interface  |

This code example features the Real Time Clock resource and one UART resource. The RTC provides time and date information – second, minute, hour, day of the week, date, month, and year. The time and date information are updated every second with automatic leap year compensation performed by the RTC hardware block. 

The CPU waits for the line feed (LF) or the carriage return (CR) character from the serial terminal. When it is received, the code parses the commands that have been sent.

- If the input command is ‘1’, updates the RTC with new date and time

- If the input command is ‘2’, enters the sub menu where we can configure DST feature using the following inputs
    
    - If the input command is ‘1’ in the sub menu, updates the RTC, when DST should start and end 
    
    - If the input command is ‘2’ in the sub menu, disables the DST feature
    
    - If the input command is ‘3’ in the sub menu, quits the DST configuration

The application uses an RTC resource from the [Hardware Abstraction Layer](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/psoc6hal) (HAL) to read or update the RTC peripheral. 
An RTC HAL resource is configured as a pointer to an RTC object whose contents are initialized by the `cyhal_rtc_init` function. This function also powers up the RTC in preparation for access.

The current time and date can be read from the RTC peripheral using the `cyhal_rtc_read`  function. Similarly, the `cyhal_rtc_write` function is used to write the specified time and date to the RTC peripheral.

In addition to these methods, the DST feature can be configured using the following functions:
- `set_dst_feature`: To enable the DST feature. Internally uses RTC HAL functions.
- `cyhal_rtc_set_dst`: To set DST start and end time.

- `cyhal_rtc_is_dst `: To check if DST is currently active.
